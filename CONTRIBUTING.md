## How to contribute?

Let's divide this into two parts:

> 1. **Contributing with a new feature**
> 2. **Contributing with a bug fix/tweak**

For the first part, you can just make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ImagineGamingPlay/Cheeku-Development/pulls) on the main branch. Be aware that Cheeka is a bot for a discord.js bot help server, essentially a server completely based on coding. So be sure that the feature you are trying to add is practical for the server type. Also, **don't make too obvious or useless commands** ex. A command for finding the oldest member of the server.

Now let's hop on the second part. For a bug fix or feature tweak, we'd appriciate if you create a issue on the [Issue Page](https://github.com/ImagineGamingPlay/Cheeku-Development/issues). Then you can claim those issues and make a fix for that. That'll make the management process smoother.
